***Did you know that if you fall in Black Hole, you are never coming out!***

Before going deep down into the detailed explanation of how am I going to link the black hole with trumpet. You must keep in mind that this blog is just an assumption it can be possible or it may be totally wrong and this blog is written from my ***own point of view*** but not from the proven research based worked or any scholar perspective.

----------------------

#### So, What is a black hole and Why I am discussing it?

![First ever black hole image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*mR6BBs7eDPAceywOjWx0uQ.jpeg "First ever black hole image")

**— For a newbie**

Black hole is a region where gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape from it. The nearest black hole is about 13.1 billion light-years away from our earth. The image that you are seeing above and probably all the images that you find on the internet they all show the same shape of black hole i-e circular body with a ring around it.

Recently in march, 2020 an article has been published on **sciencealert.com** explaining that there are infinite rings of light around the black hole and each ring has about the same diameter. By looking from a vary far distance you cannot see individual rings but can only see the shape that all these rings combine's formed.

**— Now looking on the other side, the Trumpet mentioned in Islam**

First looking at this verse of the Quran

>“And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills”
[al-Zumar 39:68]

The word ***“soor”*** **(translated here as trumpet)** means a horn like trumpet or bugle. With regard to the one who will bow into it, it is well known ***Israafeel (Pean be upon him)***

While looking at ***Sahih Al-Bukhari (vol-8)*** there is an explanation that this Trumpet body has holes in it depending on the number of souls living in this world, So each hole belongs to a specific soul and when this trumpet will be blown for the first time each soul will move back to it’s hole and there is a high possibility that when a soul enters in this world which is a newly born baby a separate hole created for him in that Trumpet.

------------



#### Conclusion

Combine the information that we have gather until now!

- Black hole do have infinite number of rings of light around it while on the other side Trumpet have number of holes equal to the living souls in this universe which is also infinite i-e uncountable.

- Black hole expanding it’s size constantly time after time probably expanding the size here representing the increase number of light rings around it while on the other side there is just an assumption that Trumpet size do increase when a new soul enter into this universe there is very less chance to reject this assumption because as mentioned earlier the holes are representing the souls so for a new soul there has to be the formation of a new hole into the Trumpet.

> In short there can be a relationship between them or maybe there is no relationship at all but few of the characteristics are quite similar between them which we cannot neglect easily!
